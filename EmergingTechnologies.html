            <p>Assignment year 3: With the subject Emerging Technologies I got introduced to the technology of the future. In this course I learned about Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things and Virtual Reality. Each technology had a small course in which I made a tiny product to show off. I really liked this subject, because it got me really excited for the future and I am happy that I learned the basics of it.

            <p>Artificial Intelligence: I made a MovieRecommender that recommends the user a movie based on their latest Twitter tweets. An AI reads the emotions and meaning of the tweet to conclude a movie for that moment.</p>

            <p>Internet of Things: I made an easel that has a beamer on the back of it. This beamer is controllable with the users voice and can so control where he or she wants its design on the canvas.</p>

            <p>Virtual Reality: For virtual reality I made an opening room for first time VR users. I combined real life elements and VR elements so that the user can calmly come into VR.</p>
